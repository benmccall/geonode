Complete Installation Guide
===========================

.. seealso:: 
   This section provides detailed instructions for manual configuration.
   For a more convenient automated install process, see :doc:`/intro/install` .

This page describes a generic installation process for GeoNode systems.
For some platforms the GeoNode project also provides customized installers which are easier to use and more reliable.

The most generic package provided by the GeoNode project is a release tar.gz ("tarball").

This is the most customizable, but also the most difficult, installation mechanism for GeoNode.

Some platforms have more convenient packages available, so check below to see whether one is available for your OS before going through these steps.


Recommended Minimum System Requirements
=======================================

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor.  (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.


Installing GeoNode from a release
=================================

What's in the Package?
----------------------

This packaging contains both the Java and Django web application code for GeoNode, and requires some external software installed (a WSGI-compliant webserver and a Java application container) to complete the GeoNode platform.

Some scripts are included to assist in configuring this external software in a default recommended configuration.

Please review these scripts carefully as they change system configuration files.

.. note:: 

   While we intend to provide a detailed, accurate explanation of the installation process, it may become out of date.
   If you run into problems with the process described in this document, please don't hesitate to let the GeoNode team know so we can keep it up to date.

The stack used is:

* *Servlet container*: `Apache Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_

* *Static file server*: `Apache httpd <http://httpd.apache.org/>`_

* *Python/WSGI container*: `mod_wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/>`_

* *Database server*: `PostgreSQL <http://postgresql.org/>`_


Download GeoNode Release Archive
--------------------------------
You get the latest GeoNode release from http://dev.geonode.org/release/ or the `GeoNode project wiki <http://dev.geonode.org/trac/>`_ .

You can extract the files using the `tar` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tar xvzf GeoNode-1.1.tar.gz
   GeoNode-1.1/geonetwork.war
   GeoNode-1.1/geonode-webapp.pybundle
   GeoNode-1.1/geoserver.war
   GeoNode-1.1/bootstrap.py
   GeoNode-1.1/deploy-libs.txt
   GeoNode-1.1/install.sh
   GeoNode-1.1/support/

This tarball comes with an install script and a directory with supporting config files.


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

As mentioned above, you must have some external software installed before you can setup GeoNode.

For convenience, appropriate commands to retrieve these dependencies for some common operating systems are listed below.

Ubuntu
......

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get update 
    $ sudo apt-get install python python-support python-dev python-virtualenv \
      openjdk-6-jre tomcat6 postgresql-8.4 gcc patch zip python-imaging \
      gdal-bin libgeos-dev python-urlgrabber python-pastescript gettext \
      postgresql-contrib postgresql-8.4-postgis libpq-dev unzip libjpeg-dev \
      libpng-dev python-gdal libproj-dev python-psycopg2 apache2  \
      libapache2-mod-wsgi


Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS
................................

Because the default repositories for CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are restricted to well-vetted packages, some of GeoNode's dependencies are not available without additional package repositories.
Adding the `Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ and `Enterprise Linux GIS <http://elgis.argeo.org>`_ repositories should allow all the dependencies to be installed.
If using a pre-built machine image such as those provided on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud service, one or both of these repositories may already be installed.
If not, they provide architecture-independent RPMs which can be used to conveniently enable the repository.
For example, on CentOS 5.x you can enable them with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   # rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm 
   # rpm -Uvh http://http://elgis.argeo.org/repos/5/elgis-release-5-5_0.noarch.rpm

You can check whether these repositories are enabled using the `yum` command:

.. code-block:: console

   # yum repo list
   ...
   elgis       EL GIS 5 - i386                                   enabled:    75
   epel        Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 5 - i386      enabled: 5,618

With these repositories in place, you can use `yum` again to install GeoNode's requirements.

.. code-block:: console

   $ yum install postgis postgresql84-server postgresql84-devel \
     python26-virtualenv python26-distribute python26-mod_wsgi gcc \
     java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel tomcat5 httpd gdal-devel

Installation
------------

GeoNode tar.gz distributions include an :file:`install.sh` script to automate basic installations (ones where GeoNode is deployed on a dedicated machine with all components on the same server.)
Aside from database setup and web application deployment, this script also sets up a few conveniences to make administration simpler:

* It installs a ``geonode`` command in the system path which can be used to access the `Django <http://djangoproject.com/>` commandline tools without navigating to the GeoNode virtualenv and specifying the settings module.

* It sets up symbolic links in :file:`/etc/geonode/` to consolidate commonly-accessed GeoNode configuration files.

* It sets up symbolic links in :file:`/var/log/geonode` to consolidate the server logs for the Python- and Java-based components of GeoNode.

To run the script:

1) The installer script has a configuration file associated with it which allows you to provide the details of your installation, such as where your webserver looks for documents.

   These vary from distribution to distribution - for example Ubuntu systems keep Apache site configurations in :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-available/` while CentOS uses :file:`/etc/httpd/conf.d/`; and of course if you are using custom-built software you may need a totally separate configuration.

   Samples for common platforms are included, please check for one that matches your distribution.

   If it is not available or you would like to install to a custom directory, the configurations are simple shell scripts and you can copy and modify one to meet your needs.

   More instructions can be found in the ``README`` distributed with the release as well as the pointer to the documentation page about configuring GeoNode for production after it has been installed.

2) After unpacking the .tar.gz archive and locating or constructing a configuration for the install, you can install GeoNode by simply running the script.
   The included configurations modify system files (such as the system httpd and Tomcat configuration files) so it is necessary to run it as a root user.)

   For example, on Ubuntu you can use the provided configuration in :file:`support/config-ubuntu.sh`:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd GeoNode-1.1/
      $ sudo ./install.sh support/config-ubuntu.sh


Manual Installation
===================

If the automated script is insufficient for your needs, the GeoNode 
This section is mostly intended for packagers working on installers for GeoNode on new platforms.
If you simply want a customized installation of GeoNode, we recommend reviewing and modifying the installer script included with GeoNode instead of starting "from scratch."

A GeoNode installation has two webservers running side-by-side, one for the Java applications and another one for the Python/Django applications and static files.

The key steps for setting up a GeoNode installation are as follows:

1) *Set up applications.*

   The GeoServer and GeoNetwork web applications must be served using a Java Servlet container; two popular and free containers are Jetty and Tomcat.

   Typically a Java web application can be deployed by simply copying the .war file into the appropriate place.

   The Django frontend can be served in various ways, one of the most performant is Apache httpd with mod_wsgi installed.

   Regardless of the specific deployment technology you choose, GeoNode includes a Pip bundle containing its Python dependencies; once you install Python and Pip for your platform you can install the rest of GeoNode's Python dependencies using ``pip install geonode-webapp.pybundle``.

   The Django project has further documentation on how to serve Django applications at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/ .

   You will also need a web server capable of simply serving static files; if you are using Apache httpd it can serve this purpose as well.

2) *Configure them to talk to each other*.

   GeoNode's components communicate over HTTP, and therefore must know each others' URLs.

   Two settings files contain the settings relevant to most GeoNode deployments:

   * GeoServer's :file:`WEB-INF/web.xml` file; this will be in the "exploded war" directory created when your servlet container deploys the GeoServer application.

     You can edit it in the text editor of your choice, add a config-param element with the name `GEONODE_BASE_URL` and the value being the base URL of your site.

   * The Django application's :file:`settings.py` file; this will be in the directory where you installed the Django application under :file:`src/GeoNodePy/settings.py`.

     In order to simplify upgrades, it is recommended to create a new file next to it named `local_settings.py` for your own settings; any settings in this file will override the default ones in the settings file included with GeoNode.

     The settings to use here are:
    
     * ``SITEURL`` the base URL for all pages in your GeoNode site, for example `http://example.com/`

     * ``GEOSERVER_BASE_URL`` the base URL for the GeoServer for your GeoNode site, for example `http://example.com/geoserver/`.

       Some features of GeoNode require you to set up a web proxy so that GeoServer and the Django application are on the same domain ("example.com" in this example.).

     * ``GEONETWORK_BASE_URL`` the base URL for the GeoNetwork for your GeoNode site, for example `http:/example.com/geonetwork/`.

     * ``GEONODE_CLIENT_LOCATION`` the URL where the static files for GeoNode are published, for example `http://example.com/media/`.  These files can be found on disk in the directory where you installed the Django application under ``src/GeoNodePy/geonode/media/`` .


Java Web Applications (WARs)
============================

GeoNode requires a Java servlet container compatible with the J2EE standard,
2.5 or higher.  `Jetty <http://jetty.mortbay.org/>`_ and `Tomcat
<http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_ are two good free servlet containers.  See their
web sites for installation and application deployment instructions.


GeoNetwork with GeoNode Schema
------------------------------

GeoNode's GeoNetwork integration requires use of a customized metadata schema.
The GeoNode project provides a custom build of GeoNetwork with this extra
schema pre-installed.  This GeoNetwork is ready to run out-of-the-box; simply
deploy using your servlet container's usual mechanism.

Steps
.....

1. *Deploy* GeoNetwork to your servlet container using the normal mechanism.
   For Tomcat and Jetty, this simply means placing ``geonetwork.war`` in the
   webapps subdirectory of the servlet container's installation directory.

2. *Configure* GeoNetwork by changing the administrative account password
   through GeoNetwork's web interface.  The administrative account username and
   password are both ``admin`` by default.

3. *Remove* the sample metadata records that are included with GeoNetwork by
   default.  To do so, you can simply perform a search with no terms after logging
   in, then use the 'Select all' link on the search results page to select all 
   records in the GeoNetwork site.  Finally, use the 'actions on selection' menu 
   to delete the records.

.. note:: 

    GeoNode releases do not include the intermap service that normally
    accompanies GeoNetwork installations.  As a result, some JavaScript errors
    come up while performing searches.  These are not a problem, and can safely
    be ignored since you will not generally used the GeoNetwork web interface
    directly.


GeoServer with GeoNode Extensions
---------------------------------

GeoNode's GeoServer integration requires some specific extensions to help
GeoNode in managing GeoServer layers.  GeoNode releases include a GeoServer WAR
archive with these extensions pre-installed.  However, some manual
configuration may still be needed.

Steps
.....

1. *Deploy* GeoServer to your servlet container using the normal mechanism.
   For Tomcat and Jetty, this simply means placing
   ``geoserver.war`` in the webapps subdirectory of the servlet
   container's installation directory.

2. *Configure* GeoServer with the location of the GeoNode site, used for
   authentication (so that GeoServer can recognize logins from the main site).
   This setting defaults to http://localhost:8000/, so if you are running
   the GeoNode Django application on a different port, or on a different server
   from the one running GeoServer, then you will need to change this by adding
   a block of XML to ``WEB-INF/web.xml`` within the unpacked application
   directory, like so::

       <context-param>
           <param-name>GEONODE_BASE_URL</param-name>
           <param-value>http://localhost:8080/</param-value>
       </context-param> 

   The ``<param-value>`` tag should enclose the URL to the Django application
   homepage.


Static Resources
----------------

The GeoNode project provides an archive of the minified JavaScript and CSS
resources used in the GeoNode site.  These media can simply be served with a
static file server such as Apache httpd or lighttpd.  See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/urlmapping.html and
http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Server.document-rootDetails
for information on configuring Apache httpd and lighttpd to serve files,
respectively.  Many other web servers are perfectly capable of serving these
files; Apache httpd and lighttpd are just examples.

Steps:
......

1. *Configure* a document root in your webserver, pointing to some directory on
   your filesystem.

2. *Extract* all the JavaScript and CSS files from the GeoNode release archive
   (geonode-client.zip) into the document root.


Django Web Application
----------------------

The GeoNode Django application should run in mod_wsgi under Apache httpd.
See the `Django project's deployment documentation 
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/modwsgi/>`_
for more information.
However, we *highly* recommend using virtualenv to sandbox the GeoNode
dependencies from the rest of the Python software on your system.

Steps:
......

1. *Install virtualenv* if you do not already have it available.  It can easily
   be installed via easy_install or pip::
   
       $ easy_install virtualenv
       $ pip install virualenv
       
2. *Prepare a sandbox* for GeoNode using virtualenv::

       $ virtualenv geonode
       $ cd geonode
       $ source bin/activate

3. *Install* the geonode python modules from the Pip bundle::

       $ pip install geonode-webapp.pybundle

   If this step fails, make sure that you have a working C++ compiler installed
   and development versions of the requisite libraries, listed in the GeoNode
   README file.

4. *Configure* the geonode Django app by editing
   ``./src/GeoNodePy/geonode/settings.py``.  The available settings and their
   usage is described elsewhere in this documentation.

5. If running via fastcgi, you can use the django-admin.py script to launch the
   fastcgi server for Django.  If running via WSGI, ensure that the virtualenv
   is added to the python path for the WSGI script.  See the official `Django
   deployment documentation
   <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/>`_ for details.


Additional Configuration
------------------------

After installing, it is highly advised to follow the :doc:`post installation guide </deploy/production>`.
